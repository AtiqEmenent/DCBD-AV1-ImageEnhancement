# DCBD-AV1-ImageEnhancement
Enhancement of AV1 compressed images using DCBDNet

### **Overview**

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) that implements an **image enhancement pipeline** for AV1-based image processing. The notebook demonstrates how to improve image quality using advanced denoising and enhancement techniques.

***

### **Notebook**

*   **File:** `your_notebook.ipynb`
*   **Purpose:**  
    The notebook performs:
    *   Loading input images
    *   Applying AV1-based denoising/enhancement algorithms
    *   Saving processed results for evaluation

***

### **Folder Structure**

    DCBD-AV1-ImageEnhancement/
    │
    ├Datasets- test - Data6FullImageCropped ── input/      # Original raw images before processing
    ├Datasets- test - Data6FullImageCropped ── target/     # Ground truth or reference images for comparison
    ├── result - Data6FullImageCropped - /     # Enhanced images generated by the notebook
    └── DCBD-AV1-imageDenoiser.ipynb

#### ✅ **Input Folder**

*   Contains **raw images** that need enhancement.
*   These are typically noisy or compressed images.

#### ✅ **Target Folder**

*   Contains **reference images** (ground truth) used for quality comparison.
*   Helps in evaluating the performance of the enhancement algorithm.

#### ✅ **Result Folder**

*   Stores **output images** after processing by the notebook.
*   These images should have improved visual quality compared to the input.

### **How to Use**

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<username>/DCBD-AV1-ImageEnhancement.git
    ```
2.  Open the notebook in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter**.
3.  Upload or link your `input`, `target`, and `result` folders.
4.  Run all cells to process images and save enhanced outputs in the `result` folder.

***

### **Requirements**

*   Python 3.x
*   Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
*   Libraries:
    *   `numpy`
    *   `opencv-python`
    *   `matplotlib`
    *   

***

### **Results**

*   The enhanced images in the `result` folder can be compared against the `target` folder using metrics like **PSNR**, **SSIM**, or visual inspection.
